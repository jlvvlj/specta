helps companies drive the transformation necessary to use AI to empower employees and build a modern workforce.

---

Just imagine what’s possible if all of your employees are able to operate at their unique and full potential – potential that continues to grow with training content they can immediately apply to improve on the work that they do. That’s the Future of Work for companies that want to continue to grow and innovate.

CEOs and employees agree that AI will transform the workplace, recent IBM studies reveal that few feel prepared to take advantage of AI’s potential:

---

In the next three years, as many as 120 million workers in the world’s 10 largest economies may need to be retrained or reskilled as a result of AI and intelligent automation, according to new research from IBM.

---

An IBM study found that two-thirds of CEOs say AI will drive significant value in HR, yet only 11 percent of Chief Human Resource Officers report their organizations have the AI, data science and machine learning skills needed to fulfill that potential.

---

84 percent of employed adults in the US and UK believe AI can drive competitive advantage, but more than half are not confident their companies can use AI for competitive advantage

## "Study conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of IBM."

> “As organizations grapple with the dual demands of undertaking digital transformation and reinventing their businesses and processes through the application of new technologies such as AI, automation and blockchain, the biggest barrier to progress will lie in accessing the right talent and skills,” said Mark Foster, senior vice president, IBM Global Business Services. “IBM believes that building a workforce to compete in the era of AI is as much about culture and specialized expertise as it is about technology.”

to drive its own workforce transformation. These services harness the power of AI personalization to guide employees in developing skills and pursuing opportunities to grow within the company

---

> When applied to IBM’s own HR function, these services drove more than $300 million in benefits to the company, $107 million in benefits in 2017 alone, and resulted in significantly better candidate, employee and manager satisfaction.

Today, all proactive companies are massively upgrading, optimizing, or completely replacing their current HR and performance improvement tools. According to Josh Bersin, more than \$2 billion was invested in the talent development market this year to keep pace with changes in the business world and the consumerization of workforce experience.

---

with heavy investments come heavy demands. Companies are now looking for more than just a talent development system, performance management or HR tools. Companies want a solution that is as agile as the business world to keep pace with the future of work.

---

With time, more and more tools flooded the corporate training market, offering an unimaginable amount of software. Even for the nearest future, they predict the market to grow at a CAGR of 9.06% by 2022. This only aggravated the situation. The problem is that countless applications don’t entail the efficiency or improvement of positive user experience due to their autonomies.

Training leaders are fed up
“We’ve more or less reached the stage where L&D executives are fed up,” writes Josh Bersin, describing the current situation on the market. Yes, vendors with their best-in-class fragmented solutions have gone too far. Training leaders don’t want to get solutions for parts and pieces of challenges. They want a robust machine – a system that would address all the challenges related to workforce management and development right away.

learning and performance management systems, etc. It all comes down to productivity.

High productivity means high profits. Also, high productivity means happy people, people who know that their contributions are making an impact. That’s why companies have been focusing on engagement

#The Future of Learning Management

---

The rapidly changing nature of work today has ushered in a new,
data-driven era in human resource (HR) management and development
– fueling the need for intelligent training informed by the power
of people analytics.

---

-Today’s intelligent learning management systems help pinpoint where
students need additional education and training as well as where you
can optimize your course content in a faster and more accurate way than
you can without the assistance of artificial intelligence.

---

-But AI’s role is constantly expanding across every industry.

-Perhaps the greatest realization for AI in the future of learning
and development is that it will help anticipate the user’s learning
path and behaviors, predict their learning needs and provide content
based on how users learn best and increase the effectiveness of e-learning

---

# Anticipated Learning Path

---

As AI continues to improve in the future, it will become easier for systems to create customized learning paths for individual users.

Transforming learning and development through an anticipated learning path means that artificial intelligence will assess user performance and determine which information path is best for the user.

AI with these capabilities will provide recommendations on what kinds of information a user’s needs, much like Netflix or Amazon provides recommendations on what shows you should watch based on your viewing behavior.

---

Google is meeting this need for its own workforce with its use of people analytics, which now informs almost all of the company’s human resources (HR) practices including development. For example, the company compares data from employee surveys with performance data to design the types of training experiences their employees want and need.

---

When it comes to HR development, today’s business environment has not only created a need for intelligent training but training that can be consumed quickly at the moment it’s needed. Today’s workers want answers fast and have little patience for training that cannot be immediately applied.

---

Just-in-time training (JITT) is one way to meet this need by providing easy access to up-to-date microlearning content (training delivered in short, easy to complete chunks). With JITT:

Employees can focus on training that is immediately relevant and as a result, can more quickly apply what they’ve learned.

---

Employees can quickly improve their performance, which can lead to greater financial rewards and recognition in the workplace and higher levels of engagement.

---

## More and more companies are adopting JITT to meet the needs of their changing workforce and are reaping its benefits, including higher productivity and greater engagement. But, they shouldn’t stop there. We believe these and the other benefits of JITT can be multiplied exponentially when combined with insights gained through the use of people analytics.

When analyzing training data provided by individual users – the types of content they are consuming, where they are struggling and where they are succeeding – together with data on their performance, patterns begin to emerge. We begin to see clearer connections between the training we provide and its real impact on performance.

---

With deeper, more accurate insights, we can create more effective training experiences tailored to the individual.

---

Further, the more data we provide the model, the more patterns emerge providing new insights we can use to create an intelligent system, one that learns as the employee learns

---

driven by your company’s KPIs, which help to identify the specific types of performance data you will need to mine from within your company. For example, if your KPI is based on revenue, you will need to collect sales data for individual employees. If your KPI relates to some elements of customer service, you would want to gather any available data that you use to measure employee success in that area.

---

# Collecting the Data

---

The data you need will come from two sources:

Data from an online learning system capable of tracking the progress of all participants. (Note that while we highly recommend the adoption of JITT, if you do not yet offer on-demand training, you can still employ an analytics approach as long as the training you provide is offered online in a system that can track training activities at the individual level.)
Employee performance and business data, which is needed to provide the feedback the system needs for the iterative modeling that ML requires.

---

data on productivity, continuous engagement, recruiting, retention, performance to reveal information that can help you take your company’s performance to the next level.
